# Givit: Give a little, help a lot

For my bachelor's thesis, I made a mobile app aiming to improve the way we donate personal belongings to charities, both for donors and charity organizations.

## Key Features:
- [as a donor] Make or upload some photos with the object you want to donate.
- [as an organization] See all the available objects and reserve them.
- [both donor & organization] Chat with the other entity involved in the donation.
- [both donor & organization] Get reviews and rewards for the donations you make.
- [as an organization] Create goals which contain more objects under the same bigger purpose.

## Tech stack
- React Native with Expo
- FastAPI
- Docker 
- PostgreSQL
- AWS S3
